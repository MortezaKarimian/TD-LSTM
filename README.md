# TD-LSTM
**TD-LSTM: a time distributed and deep-learning-based architecture for classification of motor imagery and execution in EEG signals**

TD-LSTM framework, consisting of an LSTM recurrent neural network and time distributed approach, to classify brain activities' motor imagery and execution

**Experiment environment:**
All experiments were conducted within the Anaconda environment using Python 3.6. The libraries utilized include TensorFlow version 1.15.2 and the Keras library version 2.2.4. The hardware specifications of the system comprise an Intel Core i5 9500 CPU, 8GB of RAM, and an ASUS Phoenix GeForce GTX 1050 graphics card equipped with 768 CUDA cores, with support for TensorFlow-GPU. It's worth noting that instead of employing the LSTM layer, the CuDNNLSTM layer was utilized due to its ability to leverage CUDA cores, significantly expediting the training process. For additional details regarding the experimental environment used to implement the proposed TD-LSTM method, refer to the below Figure:
